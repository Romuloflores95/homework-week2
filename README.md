1. For this project that i submitted incorrectly, i corrected the HTML file that was not originally responsive.

2. I began with the layout of the page by changing the theme and colors of the assignments.

3. Then I followed by making my "about me page" have links to both my university and workplace.

4. I made sure that the nav bar was responsive and linked appropriately to each site.

5. The about me page had to be labeled as index.html, the portfolio page was labeled as page1.html, and finally the contact page was labaeled as page2.html.

6. I additionally linked my own picture into the about me page.

7. For the bonus, I researched the form of how to create a sticky footer and it was by making the bottom margin 0px, left margin 0px and the position absolute..

8. For decoration I styled the header with my name and styled the button decorartion with an inline border.
